# Project-3
We created a program which solves system of linear equations. Two files are being created as in and out. The program gives a warning that the File couldn’t be opened if the in or out file is empty. By reading the data in the In file, the program solves the matrix. The determinant of the matrix is being found. If the value of X is equal to 0, The program gives the system of linear equations has no solutions warning. In matrices, the upper triangle is being used. In order to find the value of X, the coefficients of other unknown variables are equalized and subtracted from each other. If the variable is not zero, the row is being replacedand and the same operation is being performed for other unknown values. System of linear equations’ result being found this way and the found values are saved in the out file.
